<b>HI</b>
üíª<i>This is a very simple console game I did in C#.</i>                                                                                                                 
  
You can ‚úèmodify it as you like, you can üß†amplify it or ‚òÑcreate real games on it... if you want ofc... (^///^)

<b>NOTES:</b>

<i>1. In the code it is explained everything with comments, "u" stays for "you".                                                                             
2. Most of the functions and variables are written in italian, but I explained almost everything so u can understand (i think).                               
3. If u have trouble or want information or give me ideas, contact me on <a href="https://t.me/progettarsi">telegram</a>.                                       
4. I will update the code as i go deep in the project. If something doesn't work, give me time cause i'm probably fixing it.</i>
